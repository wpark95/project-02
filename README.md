This is a text-based heist / escape RPG game.

## Commands
- info              -->  Displays (this) game information again.
- map               -->  Shows the map.
- go [direction]    -->  Go to a different room (e.g., move east).

- escape            -->  Escape from the building.
You can also find this information while playing the game. Simply type `info` as your command!

## Hints (Spoiler Alert!)
- You can only win guards if you find and choose to acquire a taser
- Your mission objective is to find a secret document. But what if there are two different document items and one is fake and only the other one is real...?
- If you would like to play "hard" mode, try playing the game without using the `map` command.
